# Laser Table Surround

This project details the laser safety enclosure we have constructed for use with a 3x1.5m optical table. Wtih simple modifications it can be used for other sized tables.

There were some key design considerations:
* Easily customised for other tables
* Use standard materials available from multiple suppliers when possible
* Use low cost shelving so that it can be modified quickly and replaced easily if necessary
* Stand free of the table to minimise vibration when removing top access panels
* Allow removal of side panels when necessary, but not in a way to make too easy (to prevent routine disabling of a key safety feature)
* Allow variable height from table to upper covers. This can be changed as required (though will take some disassembly).

On the last point - our optical setup means that the default height on the covers requires some lab members to use steps when accessing parts of the table. We recommend thinking about what height your sides actually need to be placed at!

The file TableSurroundConstructionHelp.pdf provides a construction schematic, and the original Sketchup design file is TableWithSurround.skp. Note that this is in multiple layers containing different classes of components. The colour coding identifies identical parts (by length or type)

We settled on aluminium extrusion for the frame. There are a number of suppliers; we used "Item 8" and the parts numbers in the full parts spreadsheet ("TableSurround Parts Sheet.ods") refer to the catalogue at:
https://www.item24.de/en/productworld/building-kit-system/item-profiles.html

The file "PanelHolderCutList.txt" gives a sample cut list to generate the required lengths from standard 2m lengths  of the profile.

We used 2mm black anodised aluminium for the side panels and sprayed the outer sides with self-priming acrylic for aesthetic purposes.


We then used 10mm clear plexiglass (any supplier) for the shelving and dark 5mm plexiglass with handles from rs for the covers. Clear plexiglass is useful for the shelving as it is strong, easily cut, and allows room light to the table when not working in the dark. The dark plexiglass for the covers was chosen as we enclose the beam paths on our table, so the covers are working to provide thermal stability and prevent room light ingress rather than as the primary safety mechanism for beams travelling vertically. Use alternative materials when this is the case.

The above image shows how we prevent the panels and shelves from sliding; we use small strips of  5mm plexiglass in the upper slots of the extrusion. The strips are held in place with lengths of this:

We used LED lighting strips mounted under the lower shelving (they can be seen in the reflections on the covers in the picture of the table when lit up). These work very well  - they act as extended sources, so you cast little shadow when working on the table.
